# Folder copied over to do the first homework assignment in my repo

Code Refactor:
    In this assignment i cleaned up the previous code for easier accecability. I orginized the HTML code in a more structured and easier to read format,
    I then orginized the CSS file to corrispond to the HTML layout and added comments to explain the code.
